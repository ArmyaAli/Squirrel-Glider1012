Title of the Project: Squirrel Glider

Description: We are making an arcade web game that allows you to control a squirrel and guide him around trees. If you pass a tree you will get +1 score. The game ends when you hit a tree. (Similar to flappy bird) The twist of the game is that you will be using your voice via the web speech browser API. The squirrel will be falling unless the user makes noise to glide upwards. If we have time we will add additional special abilities, when you say a keyword it will be activated (e.g. "BOOST", "GHOST", etc.). The backend will be used for a leaderboard.

Requirements:

1.	Before the game starts, the user will be able to choose a display name
2.	To play the game, keyboard key spacebar will be the primary input
3.	Alongside the spacebar, a voice command may also be used as input
4.	The background will be scrolling during the game at a fixed scroll rate
5.	The player will always be affected by gravity and falling to the floor
6.	The tree heights will be randomized within reason
7.	Once the player has passed a tree, the score will be incremented by 1
8.	However, if the player collides with a tree edge or falls to the ground, the game will end 
9.	You will be prompted to play again, share, or check leaderboards
10.	The leaderboard must be persistent and will be provided by the NodeJS backend
11.	After the game, the user's score will be shown on a leaderboard 

If time persist:
1.	Caching the playerâ€™s best score for next time they play the game
2.	Special abilities that will be activated via voice or another keyboard input
3.	GHOST Ability: Able to go through trees for 3 seconds -> Cooldown 30 seconds
4.	BOOST Ability: Gives the player 1 dash -> Cooldown 30 seconds
5.	CHOP Ability: Gets rid of all trees on the screen -> Cooldown 30 seconds
