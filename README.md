Title of the Project: Squirrel Glider

Description: We are making an arcade web game that allows you to control a squirrel and guide him around trees. If you pass a tree you will get +1 score. The game ends when you hit a tree. (Similar to flappy bird) The twist of the game is that you will be using your voice via the web speech browser API. The squirrel will be falling unless the user makes noise to glide upwards. If we have time we will add additional special abilities, when you say a keyword it will be activated (e.g. "BOOST", "GHOST", etc.). The backend will be used for a leaderboard.
